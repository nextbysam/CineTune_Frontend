## Performance Monitoring

### Timing Breakdowns
```javascript
// Individual step timings
📦 [CAPTION-GEN] Video download completed in 1247ms
⚙️ [CAPTION-GEN] Optimization completed in 8234ms
⏱️ [CAPTION-GEN] API call completed in 2341ms
🎉 [CAPTION-GEN] Successfully retrieved 145 captions after 14.2s

// Total processing time
⏱️ [CAPTION-GEN] Total processing time: 22.4s
```

### File Size Comparisons
```javascript
📊 [VIDEO-OPT] Optimization results:
   📏 Original size: 125.34MB
   📏 Optimized size: 12.45MB
   📉 Compression: 90% reduction
   ⏱️ Processing time: 8.2s
```

## How to Use the Logging

### 1. Open Browser Developer Console
- Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux)
- Press `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
- Go to the "Console" tab

### 2. Filter Logs by Process
```javascript
// Filter for audio extraction only
[AUDIO-EXTRACT]

// Filter for caption generation only
[CAPTION-GEN]

// Filter for video optimization only
[VIDEO-OPT]

// Filter for errors only
❌

// Filter for success messages only
✅
```

### 3. Monitor Performance
Look for these key timing metrics:
- **Video download time** - Should be <5s for most files
- **Audio extraction time** - Should be 5-15s for large files
- **API call time** - Should be <10s
- **Polling time** - Varies based on file size and server load
- **Total processing time** - Should be dramatically improved with audio extraction

### 4. Debug Issues
- **Look for `❌` markers** - These indicate errors
- **Check file sizes** - Confirm optimization is working
- **Monitor timing** - Identify bottlenecks
- **Verify API responses** - Ensure server communication is working
