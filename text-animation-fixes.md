# Text Animation Fixes

## Summary
Fixed text animations that weren't working in the timeline or composition. Text elements were not applying entrance, exit, or emphasis animations despite the UI being set up correctly.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Animation State Logic Bug
- **File**: `src/features/editor/control-item/common/text-animations.tsx:40-85`
- **Problem**: The `handleSelectAnimation` function was referencing `prev` outside of the state setter callback, causing the animation state to not be properly updated
- **Fix**: Moved all animation update logic inside the state setter callback to ensure proper access to the previous state

### 2. Insufficient Animation Processing 
- **File**: `src/features/editor/player/motion-text.tsx:40-107`
- **Problem**: Animation style calculation was too simple and didn't properly handle entrance/exit animation states when not actively playing
- **Fix**: Rewrote the `getAnimationStyles` function with proper state management:
  - Added priority-based processing (entrance → emphasis → exit)
  - Fixed opacity handling for different animation types
  - Added proper visibility logic for entrance/exit animations when not playing
  - Improved transform concatenation

### 3. Limited Transform Interpolation
- **File**: `src/features/editor/utils/text-animation-utils.ts:69-82`
- **Problem**: Transform interpolation was using a simple "closest progress" approach instead of proper numeric interpolation
- **Fix**: Added proper transform interpolation system:
  - Created `interpolateTransforms` function for numeric interpolation
  - Added `extractTransformValue` helper for parsing transform properties
  - Supports translateX, translateY, scale, and rotate interpolation

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/features/editor/control-item/common/text-animations.tsx`
- Fixed animation selection and state management
- Moved dispatch logic inside state callback for proper state access
- Removed duplicate code after refactoring

### 2. `src/features/editor/player/motion-text.tsx`
- Completely rewrote animation style calculation logic
- Added proper entrance/exit animation visibility handling
- Improved transform combination and priority handling
- Fixed opacity calculation for different animation types

### 3. `src/features/editor/utils/text-animation-utils.ts`
- Enhanced transform interpolation with proper numeric calculations
- Added support for translateX, translateY, scale, and rotate properties
- Added helper functions for transform value extraction

## Animation Types Supported

### Entrance Animations
- Text is hidden before animation starts
- Plays at the beginning of text item duration
- Text becomes visible during/after animation
- **NEW**: Handwriting effect - Text appears as if being written by hand from left to right

### Exit Animations  
- Text is visible before animation starts
- Plays at the end of text item duration
- Text becomes hidden during/after animation

### Emphasis Animations
- Text remains visible throughout
- Loops during the entire text item duration
- Multiplies with base opacity instead of overriding

## Technical Improvements

1. **State Management**: Fixed callback scope issues in animation selection
2. **Performance**: Optimized animation calculations with proper frame-based logic
3. **Interpolation**: Added smooth transitions between keyframes for transforms
4. **Visibility**: Proper handling of text visibility states for entrance/exit animations
5. **Priority**: Correct animation layering and precedence handling

## NEW: Handwriting Effect Implementation

### Overview
Added a realistic handwriting animation that makes text appear as if being written by hand from left to right.

### Technical Implementation
- **Animation ID**: `handwriting`
- **Category**: Entrance animation
- **Duration**: 90 frames (3 seconds at 30fps) 
- **Icon**: ✍️

### How It Works
1. **CSS Clip-Path**: Uses `inset()` clip-path to progressively reveal text from left to right
2. **Smooth Progression**: Linear easing with 2% feather amount for smoother edges
3. **Frame-Based**: Calculates reveal percentage based on current frame position
4. **State Handling**: Proper visibility control before/during/after animation

### Code Changes for Handwriting
- **Constants**: Added handwriting preset to `TEXT_ANIMATION_PRESETS`
- **Motion Text**: Special handling in `getAnimationStyles()` for clip-path calculation
- **State Management**: Proper handling when animation is not actively playing

## Testing
The animations should now work correctly in both the timeline preview and final composition render. Users can:
- Apply entrance animations (fade-in, slide-up, pop-in, **handwriting**, etc.)
- Apply exit animations (fade-out, slide-out, zoom-out, etc.)  
- Apply emphasis animations (pulse, bounce, shake, glow)
- Combine multiple animation types on the same text element
- See smooth interpolated transitions between animation keyframes
- **NEW**: Use handwriting effect for realistic text drawing animation

All existing functionality for text styling, editing, and positioning remains unchanged.
